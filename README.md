Data exploration project using Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Scipy, Seaborn, and BeautifulSoup to examine the relationship between weather and violent crime rates. We queried NOAA's Integrated Surface Database and used publicly available crime data from large cities, chosen using the FBI's county-level crime rates.
